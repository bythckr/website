<p>Data is displayed for the year 2010, currently the only year with comprehensive data for aid flow and donor transparency ratings.</p>

No visible relation between aid money given and aid transparency

here is my take on the week 3 project about aid transparency.

In addition to the data from the Guardian I took aid data from the World bank to show which countries give and receive aid.

The choropleth map is meant to provide and overview over aid given (blue countries) and aid received (red countries), where darker colors indicate more money. One can see the connections of countries when the mouse is moved over a country on the map. Right next to the map there are 2 bar charts listing the countries by aid given and their transparency assessments.

Below the map there is more data for receiving countries, a scatterplot where aid received is related to various development indicators also from the World Bank as well as two charts ranking them by the amount received and the corresponding CPIA transparency rating.

My goal is to show the aid transparency data in the context of actual aid flow and how receiving countries spent money, e.g. how much goes into the education system.

By default graphs are show for total donation amounts but they can also be related to population and GDP, which shows different pictures.

I also uploaded two badly hand drawn sketches I created during planning the graphic. The 1st shows the overview and the 2nd one is an idea how a country detail page could look.
