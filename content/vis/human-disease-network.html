<p>This network graph visualization was created using the <a href="http://gephi.org/datasets/diseasome.gexf.zip">gexf dataset</a> from the <a href="http://diseasome.eu/">Diseasome project</a> and is rendered with the <a href="http://sigmajs.org/">JavaScript library sigma.js</a>.</p>
<p>Diseasome is a research project for exploring relationships of diseases/disorders based on the study <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/104/21/8685">The Human Disease Network</a>, Goh K-I, Cusick ME, Valle D, Childs B, Vidal M, Barabási A-L (2007), Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 104:8685-8690.</p>
<p>The beautiful graph was created by the Diseasome researchers using the <a href="https://gephi.org/">gaph visualization software Gephi</a> and the <a href="http://www.barabasilab.com/pubs/CCNR-ALB_Publications/200705-14_PNAS-HumanDisease/Suppl/index.htm">original dataset</a> from the study.</p>
