<blockquote><p>The scientific opinion on climate change is that the Earth's climate system is unequivocally warming, and it is more than 90% certain that humans are causing a significant amount of it through activities that increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as deforestation and burning fossil fuels. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change">Wikipedia</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Climate change is a controversial topic. The mainstream scientific assessment above is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_denial">denied or downplayed</a>  by several scientists and groups like the energy lobby, industry advocates and free market think tanks.</p>
<p>Even if you disagree with climate change happening and mainly caused by humans, it's hard to deny that this and related topics have received increasing attention during the past few decades.</p>
