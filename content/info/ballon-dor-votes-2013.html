<p>This post will be updated with more info soon.</p>
<p>The voting data is retrieved from this <a href="http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/ballond%27or/playeroftheyear%28men%29/02/26/02/68/fboaward_menplayer2013_neutral.pdf">PDF document</a>. The graph file was created with a Python script and preprocessed using the <a href="https://gephi.org/">Gephi visualization platform</a> to apply a Force Atlas layout as well as node sizing and coloring. The interactive version is rendered with the <a href="http://sigmajs.org/">JavaScript library sigma.js</a>.</p>
