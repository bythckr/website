<p>The first programming languages were created before modern computers existed. Between 1842-1843 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a> specified a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers with the Analytical Engine, recognized by some historians as the world's first computer program. The first programming languages designed to communicate with a computer were written in the 1950s, since then hundreds of programming languages were created.</p>
<p>Naturally some languages had a larger impact, <a href="/vis/programming-languages-influence-network-2014/#Lisp">Lisp</a> and <a href="/vis/programming-languages-influence-network-2014/#C">C</a> for example were developed in the late 1950s and 1960s respectively and are still widely used, many newer programming languages are implemented in C. The impact of a language is not limited to its usage but is also manifested in its influence on other languages. To visualize these influence relations I created different network graphs described hereafter.</p>
<p>The data on programming languages, their influence relations and the programming paradigms they are classified into comes from the <a href="http://www.freebase.com/view/computer/programming_language">Freebase Programming Language collection</a>, which is largly based on information from <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>. Please be aware that data from Freebase is not necessarily correct nor comprehensive. If you spot an error, please let me know in the comments and, if you can, correct the information on Freebase.</p>
<p>All of the following visualizations have several features in common:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming languages are displayed as nodes in the form of circles.</li>
<li>Influence relations are displayed as edges in the form of lines (straight or curved).</li>
<li>Node sizes reflect the number of languages a language has influenced, i. e. outdegree.</li>
<li>A programming language can pertain to different programming paradigms.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Programming Languages Influence Visualization</h2>
<p>My first attempt in October 2011 to visualize programming language infleunce resulted in <a href="http://geeksta.net/visualizations/programming-language-influence-by-paradigm-gallery/">these static graphics</a> created with the <a href="https://networkx.github.io/">NetworkX</a> and <a href="http://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> Python libraries. Each graphic shows the influence relations of programming languages that pertain to a specific programming paradigm, e. g. object-oriented programming, procedural programming or functional programming to name a few. The languages are arranged in circular layouts.</p>
<p>In August/September 2012 I gave another go at this topic resulting in this <a href="/vis/programming-languages-influence-network-d3/">browser based visualization</a> created using <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>. This graph consists of 1170 nodes and 908 edges with a force layout applied. There is not much more to say about it except that I wasn't really satisfied and looked for alternative tools, which I found in the <a href="http://sigmajs.org/">JavaScript library sigma.js</a> and the <a href="">Gephi visualization platform</a>. Both these tools were fundamental to create the interactive visualizations described in a bit more detail below.</p>
<h3>Interactive Visualizations Created with Sigma.js and Gephi</h3>

<p>The <a href="/vis/programming-languages-influence-network/">programming languages influence visualization</a> shows an interactive network graph of programming language influences. The graph consists of 1183 programming language nodes and 972 edges that signify an influence relation.</p>
<p>The size of a node is determined by its out degree. The more influential a language is across all languages in the network, the bigger is the corresponding node in the network.</p>
<p>There are several ways of interaction: you can restrict the network to languages within a programming paradigm; you can choose between a Force Atlas 2 and a random graph layout; and you can highlight the connections of a language by searching for its name in the top menu.

<p>This network graph visualization was created with data from the <a href="http://www.freebase.com/view/computer/programming_language">Freebase Programming Language collection</a>. Please be aware that data from Freebase is not necessarily correct nor comprehensive. If you spot an error, please let me know in the comments and, if you can, fix it in Freebase itself.</p>
<p>The graph is rendered with the <a href="http://sigmajs.org/">JavaScript library sigma.js</a>. The Force Atlas 2 layout was preprocessed using the <a href="https://gephi.org/">Gephi visualization platform</a>.</p>
<p>You find the Python code to retrieve the data from Freebase and generate json and gexf files in this <a href="https://github.com/exploringdata/programming-languages-influence">GitHub repository</a>. The data was last updated July 11 2013. Feel free to leave feedback in the comments and share this visualization with your friends.</p>

<p>The <a href="/vis/programming-languages-influence-network-2014/">programming languages influence visualization</a> shows an interactive network graph of programming language influences. The graph consists of XXX programming language nodes and XXX edges that signify an influence relation.</p>
<p>Language nodes are colored by their <em>Modularity Classes</em> , which were calculated in Gephi using an algorithm devised by Vincent D Blondel, Jean-Loup Guillaume, Renaud Lambiotte, Etienne Lefebvre in the paper <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0476">Fast unfolding of communities in large networks</a>.</p>
<p>The 2014 poster only includes languages that have influenced at least one other language for a less noisy graphic.</p>
