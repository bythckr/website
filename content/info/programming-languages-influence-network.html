<p>The <a href="/vis/programming-languages-influence-network/">programming languages influence visualization</a> shows an interactive network graph of programming language influences. The graph consists of 1169 programming language nodes and 908 edges that signify an influence relation.</p>
<p>The size of a node is determined by its out degree. The more influential a language is across all languages in the network, the bigger is the corresponding node in the network.</p>
<p>There are several ways of interaction: you can restrict the network to languages within a programming paradigm; you can choose between a Force Atlas 2 and a random graph layout; and you can highlight the connections of a language by searching for its name in the top menu. For more details click on the help link in the top menu.</p>
<p>This network graph visualization was created with data from the <a href="http://www.freebase.com/view/computer/programming_language">Freebase Programming Language collection</a>. Please be aware that data from Freebase is not necessarily correct nor comprehensive. Also the dataset is a snapshot from September 2012, information on Freebase may have changed since then.</p>
<p>The graph is rendered with the <a href="http://sigmajs.org/">JavaScript library sigma.js</a>. The Force Atlas 2 layout was preprocessed using the <a href="https://gephi.org/">Gephi visualization platform</a>.</p>
<p>You find the Python code to retrieve the data from Freebase and generate json and gexf files in this <a href="https://github.com/exploringdata/programming-languages-influence">GitHub repository</a>. The data was last updated October 5 2012. Feel free to leave feedback in the comments and share this visualization with your friends.</p>
