<p>The <a href="/vis/programming-languages-influence-network/">programming languages influence visualization</a> shows an interactive network graph of programming language influences. The graph consists of 1183 programming language nodes and 972 edges that signify an influence relation.</p>
<p>The size of a node is determined by its out degree. The more influential a language is across all languages in the network, the bigger is the corresponding node in the network.</p>
<p>There are several ways of interaction: you can restrict the network to languages within a programming paradigm; you can choose between a Force Atlas 2 and a random graph layout; and you can highlight the connections of a language by searching for its name in the top menu. For more details click on the help link in the top menu.</p>
<p>This network graph visualization was created with data from the <a href="http://www.freebase.com/view/computer/programming_language">Freebase Programming Language collection</a>. Please be aware that data from Freebase is not necessarily correct nor comprehensive. If you spot an error, please let me know in the comments and, if you can, fix it in Freebase itself.</p>
<p>The graph is rendered with the <a href="http://sigmajs.org/">JavaScript library sigma.js</a>. The Force Atlas 2 layout was preprocessed using the <a href="https://gephi.org/">Gephi visualization platform</a>.</p>
<p>You find the Python code to retrieve the data from Freebase and generate json and gexf files in this <a href="https://github.com/exploringdata/programming-languages-influence">GitHub repository</a>. The data was last updated July 11 2013. Feel free to leave feedback in the comments and share this visualization with your friends.</p>
