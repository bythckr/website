<p>The first programming languages were created before modern computers existed. Between 1842-1843 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a> specified a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers with the Analytical Engine, recognized by some historians as the world's first computer program. The first programming languages designed to communicate with a computer were written in the 1950s, since then hundreds of programming languages were created.</p>
<p>Naturally some languages had a larger impact, <a href="/vis/programming-languages-influence-network-2014/#Lisp">Lisp</a> and <a href="/vis/programming-languages-influence-network-2014/#C">C</a> for example were developed in the late 1950s and 1960s respectively and are still widely used, many newer programming languages are implemented in C. The impact of a language is not limited to its usage but is also manifested in its influence on other languages. To visualize these influence relations I created different network graphs described hereafter.</p>
<p>The data on programming languages, their influence relations and the programming paradigms they are classified into comes from the <a href="http://www.freebase.com/view/computer/programming_language">Freebase Programming Language collection</a>, which is largly based on information from <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>. Please be aware that data from Freebase is not necessarily correct nor comprehensive. If you spot an error, please let me know in the comments and, if you can, correct the information on Freebase.</p>
<p>All of the following visualizations have several features in common:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming languages are displayed as nodes in the form of circles.</li>
<li>Influence relations are displayed as edges in the form of lines (straight or curved).</li>
<li>Node sizes reflect the number of languages a language has influenced, i. e. outdegree.</li>
<li>A programming language can pertain to different programming paradigms.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Programming Languages Influence Visualization</h2>
<p>My first attempt in October 2011 to visualize programming language infleunce resulted in <a href="http://geeksta.net/visualizations/programming-language-influence-by-paradigm-gallery/">these static graphics</a> created with the <a href="https://networkx.github.io/">NetworkX</a> and <a href="http://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> Python libraries. Each graphic shows the influence relations of programming languages that pertain to a specific programming paradigm, e. g. object-oriented programming, procedural programming or functional programming to name a few. The languages are arranged in circular layouts.</p>
<p>In August/September 2012 I gave another go at this topic resulting in this <a href="/vis/programming-languages-influence-network-d3/">browser based visualization</a> created using <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>. This graph consists of 1170 nodes and 908 edges with a force layout applied. There is not much more to say about it except that I wasn't really satisfied and looked for alternative tools, which I found in the <a href="http://sigmajs.org/">JavaScript library sigma.js</a> and the <a href="https://gephi.org/">Gephi visualization platform</a>. Both these tools were fundamental for creating the interactive visualizations described in a bit more detail below.</p>
<h3>Interactive Visualizations Created with Sigma.js and Gephi</h3>
<p>I retrieved the data for these visualizations with a Python script you find in <a href="https://github.com/exploringdata/programming-languages-influence">this repository</a>. This script also creates a <a href="http://gexf.net/format/">gexf file</a>, which I then manually edited using Gephi.</p>
<p>To render the edited gexf files in a Web browser I used Sigma.js and developed the following ways of interacting with the displayed information from the top menu bar and using the mouse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search languages and highlight their connections from the autocomplete input field in the top bar. In the highlighted mode languages shown in orange influenced the highlighted language and blue ones were influenced by it.</li>
<li>Filter by programming paradigm from the dropdown in the top menu and you'll only see languages that pertain to the selected paradigm. Note that the node sizes don't change when the paradigm filter is active, which should be improved.</li>
<li>Choose a either a random layout or reset back to the Force Atlas layout created in Gephi from the dropdown in the top bar.</li>
<li>When you click on a node a modal window with information about the programming language shows up.</li>
<li>You can zoom the graph using the mousewheel and drag it around when holding the mouse button clicked.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's now look at the details for the different interactive versions.</p>

<p>The data for <a href="/vis/programming-languages-influence-network/">the 2013 version</a> was downloaded on July 11, 2013 and contains information on 1183 programming languages, the nodes in the network. These languages are connected by 972 influence relations shown as edges.</p>
<p>The ######### Force Atlas 2 layout algorithm was applied to this graph in Gephi as well as

<h3>Programming Languages Influnce 2014</h3>
<div class="pull-right col-md-4"><a href="http://www.zazzle.com/programming_languages_influence_network_2014_poster-228756590438836612?rf=238355915198956003" target="_top"><img class="img-responsive" src="http://rlv.zcache.com/programming_languages_influence_network_2014_poster-rba8de641deee4bd2a339178aaa87b679_wvo_8byvr_325.jpg" alt="Programming Languages 2014 Poster"></a></div>
<p>The <a href="/vis/programming-languages-influence-network-2014/">programming languages influence visualization</a> shows an interactive network graph of programming language influences. The graph consists of XXX programming language nodes and XXX edges that signify an influence relation.</p>
<p>Language nodes are colored by their <em>Modularity Classes</em> , which were calculated in Gephi using an algorithm devised by Vincent D Blondel, Jean-Loup Guillaume, Renaud Lambiotte, Etienne Lefebvre in the paper <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0476">Fast unfolding of communities in large networks</a>.</p>
<p>The 2014 poster only includes languages that have influenced at least one other language for a less noisy graphic.</p>
