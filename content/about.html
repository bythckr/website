<p>Hi my name is <a href="http://www.ramiro.org/">Ramiro</a>, I created <a href="http://geeksta.net/">Geeksta</a> to write about programming, data mining and visualization, tech books I read, and other topics I find interesting from the point of view of a geek.</p>
<p>I started publishing on the Web back in the late 1990s and creating and contributing to open source software projects in 2002. Most of the stuff I've worked on is scattered across the Web, with this site I intend to bundle my future &mdash; and maybe some of my past &mdash; tech related projects in one place.</p>
<p>Back to scattered across the Web, you also find me on <a href="https://github.com/yaph" rel="me">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/111266755406371391519" rel="me">Google+</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/yaph" rel="me">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/gomezramiro" rel="me">LinkedIn</a> and several <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ramiro+gomez">other places</a>. Regarding the search results, lots of them are about other people including artists, actors and criminals.</p>
